Alernate approach

240 injections
5 rats
poision affects in 24hr
total time for experiment 48hrs

Solution:
240/5=48 injection per rat
48 injection in every half hour ~ 48x1/2=24 , hence in 24 hours all rats will be vaccinated and 48-24 =24 hr exact time required for poision to show its effect

hence we can determine which injection is poisionous
